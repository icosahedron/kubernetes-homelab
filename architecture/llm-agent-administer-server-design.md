I would like to create a workflow where I can configure and administer a remote server via a conversation with
an LLM. For example, I would like to say something like "Please install Python 3.12 on server xyz.example.com.",
and it would connect to the server, presumably SSH, and then run the commands to install.

For this reason, I don't simply want to create a script for a one time installation or configuration. I'd like something that I 
can ask individual tasks as necessary, or sometimes ask for a bigger task and have them strung together.

This sounds like something best accomplished by agents. Would this be best accomplished to an MCP agent, or is there another way 
to do this that would be composable by an LLM?

Here's an example of a conversation I might like to have (... prefixes use of an agent by the LLM):

Me: "Can you install the docker version of Postgres on server example1.icosahedron.org"

LLM: "Yes, I can do that. Let me verify I have the connection requirements to example.icosahedron.org"
... Uses some commands to verify the connection. Possibly using SSH and verifying that example1.icosahedron.org is in the config.
... Connects to the server and verifies docker is installed (e.g. docker --help)
... Runs "docker pull ..." followed by "docker run ..."
"Task complete. Postgres is installed on example1."

Me: (Tries running the 'psql --host example1 etc.' command but can't connect).
"I can't connect to it with psql. What might be the problem?"

LLM: (Thinking...) "Are you connecting to port 5432? Maybe the firewall isn't open."

Me: "That's good thinking. Can you verify that port is open on the firewall and open it if it's not?"

LLM: "Sure. Let me check that."
... Uses same commands to connect to example1.
... Uses 'ufw status' to verify that the port is not open.
... Opens the port using 'ufw allow 5432' or some equivalent.
"The port is now open. Please try to connect again."

Me: (After running psql which connects.) Thanks. That seems to work fine.

Something like this which would allow me to administer servers with simple commands that the LLM would figure out from the
descriptions I give it, or answer questions about the server that I ask using the same agents.

If the LLM gets stuck, it should ask questions about what it needs to know to accomplish the task.

While thinking about this, don't write any code, but let's think about this and determine what would be the best
vehicle to allow the LLM to perform these tasks? Would a set of MCP tools be the best, or are there other agentic
technology that would be better suited (something like LangChain or Pocket Flow)?

Also, what commands or tools would the agent(s) need to know to be able to adminster a server? I can
think of a few: connect, execute, disconnect.

Let's continue this conversation. What are your thoughts?
